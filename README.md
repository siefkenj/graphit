Graphit
=======

Graphit is a browser-based application for creating mathematical figures.
Based on the asciisvg library, Graphit uses javascript code to create figures 
which can then be saved in SVG format. Using javascript allows for the 
graphing of arbitrary user-defined functions as well as complicated figures 
(such as an illustration of a Riemann Sum) that other graphing packages do 
not provide tools for.

Liscense
========

Graphit is liscensed under the GPL-3.  Projects accessed as libraries
by graphit (such as asciisvg) retain their original liscense.
